<h3 align="center">App that helps young parents manage diet of their babies</h3>

Idea of an application came from need to write down amount of milk consumed by my baby to track it's growth.
Then came the moment of diet extension, which was a second reason to develop application.
Adding and implementing new features was done simultaneously with developing app structure based on REST architecture.

1. CRUD operations for consumed meals
2. Displaying history of consumed meals
2. Displaying statistics of consumed meals
2. Giving propositions of meals based on babies preferences
